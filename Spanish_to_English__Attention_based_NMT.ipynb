        "Due to language barriers, a US-based life insurance company is facing a challenge in communicating with the Spanish-speaking community in Mexico. The locals there need help in understanding English, and the company cannot provide translators for all of them. To overcome this challenge and provide coverage to the locals, the company needs a machine translation model that can accurately translate the application request letter from Spanish to English.\n",

        "**Problem Statement:** Your task is to build an **attention-based sequence-to-sequence model** that can effectively understand the context of Spanish sentences and translate them into clear and coherent English sentences. The company aims to use this model to ensure seamless communication and provide coverage to the Spanish-speaking community in Mexico.\n",
